# Locker
Project objective: develop a Finit State Machine for digital lock control that recognizes the sequence of keystrokes. If the sequence is correct, the lock opens and the corresponding LED lights up. If the combination sequence is incorrect - the lock remains closed, the seven-segment indicators display the wrong combination. The sequence consists of 6 decimal numbers(1-6).
